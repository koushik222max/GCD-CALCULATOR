This Python script uses a clean, recursive approach to get the job done â€” no manual factor listing, no sweat.

## How It Works
- Uses the **Euclidean Algorithm** for optimal speed and simplicity.
- Works with both hard-coded examples and user input.
- Recursively computes until the remainder hits zero.

## Example Output
78
44
GCD = 2


## Try It Yourself
